one-sample t-test

In this example, we'll create a dataset with  
two independent groups and then perform the t-test.
 
data blood_sugar_groups; 
    input patients $ group $ sugar_level; 
    datalines; 
John A 100 
Dean A 90 
Pam A 120 
Mike A 110 
Sean B 80 
Joey B 70 
Chant B 85 
Wilkins B 82 
; 
run; 
 
proc ttest data=blood_sugar_groups; 
    class group; /* Specify the grouping variable */ 
    var sugar_level; /* Specify the variable for which you want to compare means */ 
run; 
 
If the p-value for the equality of variances test  
(such as Levene's test) is 0.2893, this indicates that you do not  
have sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis of equal variances.  
Typically, a common threshold for significance is 0.05. Since 0.2893 is  
greater than 0.05, you can conclude that the variances of the two groups  
are likely equal. 
 
Recommendation: 
- Use the Pooled t-test**: Given that the p-value for the equality of  
variances is 0.2893, you can confidently use the pooled t-test for your  
analysis. This approach assumes equal variances and is generally more  
powerful when this assumption holds true. 
 
In summary, with a p-value of 0.2893, you should choose the pooled p-value 
for your t-test results.
